This is a project completed as a requirement for the course EE531: Estimation and Detection Theory at IIT Mandi. We were given a dataset consisting of 86 subjects, 50 epileptic and 36 healthy, and we needed to build a classifier and gauge the performance of it using the ROC curve. The final deliverable for the project was the ROC curve with an IEEE style paper summarizing the result.
